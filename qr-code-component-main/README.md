## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my understanding of the basics of HTML and CSS, focusing on layout with Flexbox and working with CSS custom properties for styling consistency.

Here is a small example of the CSS I am proud of:

```css
.container {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 15px;
  padding: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```
